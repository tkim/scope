# Scope - Serverless Open Source Status Board</h1>

Scope is a customizable bird's eye view of your Github project.

It automatically pulls in issues & Pull requests and sorts them into columns you define. Think github projects on steroids.

Built using event driven serverless tech, the application can be cloned down, configured, & deployed for your project in minutes.

Deploy it as a stand-alone application or embed it directly into your project's site.

Run it for **[free](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)** under AWS's generous free tier.
